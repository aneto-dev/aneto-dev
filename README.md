## About

I design and operate production-grade backend systems focused on:

- Reliability and safe deployments  
- Observability by default  
- Distributed systems architecture  
- ML systems deployed into real operational workflows  

My work blends backend engineering, event-driven design, and production-grade observability practices.

I focus on building observable, resilient systems designed for safe evolution at scale.

## Engineering Philosophy

- Design for operability, not just correctness  
- Ship safely using progressive rollout strategies  
- Make trade-offs explicit  
- Prefer simple systems with strong observability  
- Treat ML systems as production software, not experiments

## Featured Projects

Selected systems demonstrating production observability, distributed workflows, and ML in deployment.

- **ML Observable Prediction Platform** — Safe model rollout patterns (shadow traffic), drift monitoring, and full instrumentation.  
  https://github.com/aneto-dev/ml-observable-prediction-platform

- **.NET Observability API** — ASP.NET Core service with OpenTelemetry tracing, Prometheus metrics, and Grafana dashboards.  
  https://github.com/aneto-dev/dotnet-observability-api

- **Event-Driven Microservices System** — RabbitMQ-based workflows with reliability patterns (retries, idempotency, outbox-style thinking).
